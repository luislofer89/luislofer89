# Technical Project Manager & Machine Learning Engineer

Hello, my name is Luis. I am 33 years old living in St. Gallen, Switzerland.

Currently I am working as a Generative AI Lead & Technology Project Manager at [Hexagon](https://hexagon.com/) Innovation Hub, where I design and implement AI-driven innovations, orchestrate transformative projects, and lead cross-functional teams towards exceeding our technological goals, bridging the gap between academic AI research and industry applications.

I am proud to be part of the Image & Point Cloud Analytics team, where I fuse technological advancements with real-world user needs, translating complex challenges into actionable, state-of-the-art AI-powered solutions. My role allows me to combine analytical problem-solving with creative ideation, shaping the very future of reality capture with AI.

In the past, I collaborated with universities on diverse research projects, helped startups skyrocket their growth using AI, designed and developed a complete real-time software stack for LiDAR processing for an top automotive OEM and collaborated with multidisciplinary experts, translating complex problems into actionable AI-powered solutions on multiple fields.

I discovered my passion for Artificial Intelligence and Project Management over a decade ago and have remained committed to pushing the boundaries of my personal knowledge and skills. Today, I am diving deep into areas like explainable AI, AI-powered automation, Machine Learning Operations (MLOps), and tailoring AI models for edge computing to bring innovation to the forefront and generate exceptional business value.

I write about all the stuff I am exploring under [my personal notes](https://www.luislf.xyz/blog) and you can find me on [linkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/luislopezfdez), X(twitter) @[luislofer89](https://twitter.com/luislofer89) or [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/luisloez89)

## üî≠ A bit more about me
‚úÖ I‚Äôm currently engrossed in developing efficient models for real time on-device applications, unleashing the potential of AI in Reality Capture.

‚úÖ Leading initiatives that focus on tayloring AI workflows for sustainable and data efficient training processes.

‚úÖ Excited about building a platform for the use of LLMs as a reasoning engine to eliminate the direct interaction between custormers and technical documentation.

üå± Always enhancing my knowledge, I‚Äôm currently delving into the synergy between blockchain and AI, along with the improvement of leadership and project management skills.

üëØ Keen to collaborate on ambitious projects, especially AI-for-good initiatives or innovations that drive both mental and phisical well-being.

üí¨ Reach out if you want to discuss the future of AI, its ethical considerations, or its convergence with other emerging technologies.

‚ö° Fun fact: Tried teaching an AI model my native language's slang. The results? Hilariously off-mark! However, I am not giving up and I am trying again by using [Llama2](https://ai.meta.com/llama/) and [Seamless-M4T](https://ai.meta.com/blog/seamless-m4t/).
